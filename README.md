## FAQ
*What file formats can I upload to Shiny Panda?*

You can upload `.csv`, `.tsv`, `.xls`, and `.xlsx`. This list may expand in the future.

*Is there a max file size?*

Yes, the max file size is currently capped at 5 MB, but this limit may be increased in the future.

*Is it normal for it to take a long time to generate a report?*

Yes, unfortunately, sometimes pandas can be slow.
